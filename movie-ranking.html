<h1>The Best Movies According to Ankitha</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Darling</h3>
<p>It's a beautiful love story. Songs and Background music made me cherish this movie forever. Prabhas and Kajal nailed it. Whenever I watch this film, it always gives me a fresh feel.</p>
<h3>Arundhati</h3>
<p>It's a female-oriented film. It's an excellent and scary movie. The Concept is entirely different. The climax was superb. I feel nostalgic whenever I watch this movie. Anushka and Sonu Sood did justice for their roles. They nailed it.</p>
<h3>Godavari</h3>
<p>It's a feel good movie. Sita and Ram characters are lovable with natural expressions. I enjoyed the scenic beauties of River Godavari and surrounding places.</p>
